            <p>
              My attention was first drawn to the grid layout on the left side

              I spent the most time on the main page. I interacted with each box
              in the advent calendar, explored the objects inside, and scrolled
              through the list of projects on the right. This part allowed for
              the most interaction.

              Clicking was the most common action. I frequently clicked on

            <p>
              I think the main goal is to present the creator’s work in a
              creative and engaging way, encouraging visitors to explore the
              portfolio more deeply. I believe this goal is communicated
              effectively through playful interactions, such as the advent
              calendar concept, which makes the experience feel unique compared
              to a standard portfolio.

              Each project includes clear information such as the title,

              Depending on the user, the experience can last from about 3

              while others may take time to read the details of each project.
              The “LAST UPDATED 21 DEC, 2023” note suggests that the site is not
              updated often, so users might revisit it only when new content is
              added.

              The site is designed around free exploration, allowing users to
              interact with elements at their own pace. The update date at the
              bottom of the page gives a clue that new content may be added
              occasionally, suggesting that users could return in the future.

              It references the traditional advent calendar, a non-digital form
              used during December to count down to Christmas. The idea of
              opening boxes to find surprises is reinterpreted here through
              digital interaction.

              The advent calendar reference communicates that I should act with

              to discover its content. This design encourages exploration rather
              than quick skimming, guiding me to interact with the portfolio in
              a playful way.

            <p>
              Advent calendars usually evoke feelings of excitement and
              anticipation. Similarly, this experience feels cheerful and fun,
              especially through its use of festive objects and a bright visual
              style that adds to a joyful atmosphere.

            <p>
              Some calendar boxes didn’t respond when clicked. Since I expected
              each box to contain an interactive element, it was a bit confusing
              and disappointing when nothing happened. Also, it wasn’t always
              clear which elements were clickable.

            <p>
              The advent calendar idea itself was very enjoyable. Each box
              offered a new interaction, which made the experience feel like a
              small adventure. I also appreciated the thoughtful design - the
              Christmas-themed objects seemed meaningful, showing creater's
              attention to detail.
